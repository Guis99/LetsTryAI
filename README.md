I will attempt to create a NN model to classify hand-written numbers

Classifies (in theory) a 28x28 pixel image of a handwritten digit as an integer between 0 and 9. Again, MUST feed a 28x28 pixel image for this to work, otherwise we'll get an IndexOutOfBounds error and nobody likes those.

Will train using data from MNIST database.
